Can you explain quantum entanglement in simple terms for a 10-year-old?

<Qwen2.5-0.5B-DPO/checkpoint-15533>:
Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles are related to one another in such a way that
their state or properties, once determined, can be predicted even by an infinite number of other particles far
away from each other. This means that the physical state of the particles is correlated when they are
separated. For example, when two particles of antimatter are placed in a small box containing a single light
switch, and the switch is suddenly turned on, the particles will then appear to collide and form a beam of
particles, and the light switch's behavior will affect the particles' movement, just like particles in a box
would.

The best place to start in this area is to look for local, independent business and start small. Look through
the community directories to find businesses that are looking to hire part-time or full-time workers to help
the business with some tasks (think "mowing the lawn") rather than hiring a professional that is just too
expensive. Also, looking for independent owners who are working on small business can be a great way to expand
your career and create a new business in your own community.

If you see an open position at an organization (for example, a lawyer or a human resources manager), do some research on
the person's background (what it is they can offer, experience etc.). Then, write an opening email, which reads
something like this.
Subject: Job Referral Request
Hey boss, I was thinking that maybe you could offer me the role of ___________.
Feel free to get back to me with any details you were looking for or to clarify anything else I may have said.

Could you let me know how much time you have available for work on the job as well? I would rather work from home and be
more flexible in terms of availability, as long as it's available for me. I also have a full-time job at home, with a
lot of work to do, but I'm happy to be flexible with the hours.

If you are able to help me find a job, I would be more than happy to provide you with more information.

Thank you for considering my application. I would greatly

Quantum entanglement is a fascinating phenomenon in the field of quantum mechanics. It's like watching two particles
come together and become connected, no matter how far apart they are in the universe. Imagine two superpowers, like
being able to open doors and see through walls — it means you have the ability to have both powers at once, just like
they are one entity. In quantum entanglement, particles can be connected in such a way that whether one particle is in
place or not, the other one instantly has the opposite condition.
